## About The Project

![](public\images\MainPage.JPG)

There are a ton of dating websites out there that just don't work for most people. It can take months, if not YEARs, to come accross someone you truly enjoy and want to be with. Hooked is the dating site that may just land you a solid catch!

Here's our why:

Your time is valuable. Our time is valuable. With so many fish in the sea it doesn't make sense to talk to each potential catch one by one. Life is too short and no one has time to throw fish after fish back into the sea because they're not what you want. With our site, you can chat with a larger group of people at the same time! From our experience, it's much easier to see what attracts you to someone when you're exposed to them in a group setting in addition to the typical one on one interaction you get with other websites. This site means something to us because we're swimming with you! It makes sense for us to make the waters as smooth and clear as possible. 


## Built using:

* Node.js

* Handlebars.js
* MySQL and Sequelize
* Socket.IO (for chat)
